Duper aims to be a human-friendly extension of JSON with quality-of-life improvements, extra types, and semantic identifiers.

[Check out the official website](https://duper.dev.br) for examples, quick start guides, and more.

## Why Duper?

Duper excels in a variety of use cases:

- In configuration files, where users are expected to swap out values, its explicit types can be a helpful guide.
- Thanks to its self-documenting identifiers, Duper feels right at home in REST APIs.
- With support for bytes and raw data, minimal syntax, and compatibility with JSON, Duper is also a great choice for data interchange.

## A formal specification for implementers
